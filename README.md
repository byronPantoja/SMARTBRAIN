# SMARTBRAIN

**FINAL PROJECT: ZTM Course - _The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery_**

---

_This is my third time doing this project. Here's what I learned this time around._

- Take a look at the mockup/sample/design of the app you're building and begin breaking it down into components
- start the react app and begin building out the components in app.js to help guide the development process
- I'm not adding the tilt.js or particles etc. Just going to keep my app clean and lightweight
